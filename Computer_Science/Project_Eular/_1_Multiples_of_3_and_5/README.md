### Approach for solving Problem

- Take the elements up to 30
  ![Element](./assets/images/element.jpeg)

- here we can see multiples of 3 and 5 sa:

- Summation can be

- **But there are repeatations of multiplications of 3*5 in both**
- we need to remove them once
- Find intersection between two sets
  ![sets](./assets/images/sets.png)

- they are multiplications of 15
- By removing them total sum becomes
